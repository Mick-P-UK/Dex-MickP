## Previous Session Work (2026-02-08 16:38-16:58)

**✅ COMPLETED: YouTube Content Management System Implementation**

Fully implemented a project-based YouTube content system for managing video creation across both DIY-Investors channels (.com and .ai).

**✅ COMPLETED: Obsidian Integration Setup**

Set up Obsidian sync daemon for bidirectional task synchronization between Obsidian and Dex. Configured to run automatically at session start via session-start hook.

**✅ COMPLETED: Fixed Windows Startup Hook Error**

Hook temporarily disabled - Claude Code starts successfully. Need to debug why hook was hanging (likely Obsidian daemon check or PowerShell command parsing).
