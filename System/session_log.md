# Session Log

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10 18:05
**Status:** 📋 Preparing for GitHub commit

## Current Focus

**🔧 Development Toolkit Exploration + Pre-Commit Documentation (ACTIVE)**

Mick has systematically loaded five comprehensive development skills to understand the full Dex development capabilities:

**Development Skills Loaded:**
1. **`/anthropic-mcp-builder`** (17:56) - Backend integration via MCP servers
   - Four-phase workflow: Research → Implementation → Review → Evaluation
   - TypeScript (recommended) and Python support
   - Create tools for LLM-service integration

2. **`/anthropic-skill-creator`** (17:58) - Workflow packaging as skills
   - Six-step process: Understand → Plan → Initialize → Edit → Package → Iterate
   - Progressive disclosure design (metadata → SKILL.md → bundled resources)
   - Scripts, references, and assets organization

3. **`/anthropic-web-artifacts-builder`** (18:00) - Frontend development
   - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
   - 40+ pre-installed shadcn/ui components
   - Bundle to single HTML file for claude.ai artifacts

4. **`/anthropic-webapp-testing`** (18:01) - Testing & QA automation
   - Python Playwright for local web app testing
   - Server lifecycle management (with_server.py)
   - Reconnaissance-then-action pattern for dynamic webapps

5. **`/dex-update`** (18:02) - Automatic Dex system updates
   - Git-based update workflow with conflict resolution
   - Protects user data and customizations (USER_EXTENSIONS, custom-* MCPs/skills)
   - Non-technical friendly (2-5 minutes, no command line knowledge)
   - Example of production-grade skill with scripts and progressive disclosure

**Current Action (18:03-18:05):**
- Documenting skill exploration session in session log
- Preparing for GitHub commit
- All changes documented before commit

**Background context:** Silver video editing in progress (Descript), publish target Thursday Feb 12.

## Recent Actions (2026-02-10 17:56-18:05)

**📚 Comprehensive Development Toolkit Exploration**

**Purpose:** Systematic exploration of Dex development capabilities by loading all major development skills.

**Skills loaded (17:56-18:02):**
1. MCP Builder - Backend/integration layer
2. Skill Creator - Workflow packaging
3. Web Artifacts Builder - Frontend/UI development
4. Web App Testing - Testing/automation
5. Dex Update - System update automation (also serves as excellent skill reference example)

**Pre-commit documentation (18:03-18:05):**
- Updated session log with comprehensive skill exploration details
- Verified CHANGELOG.md (no system changes to document - this is exploratory work)
- Ready for GitHub commit

**Next:** Execute GitHub commit with proper documentation of this exploration session.

## Recent Actions (2026-02-10 16:15-16:30)

**✅ Permanent Date Verification Fix**

After incorrectly saying "Wednesday (today)" when it was Tuesday Feb 10, implemented permanent fix:

1. **Updated CLAUDE.md (line 619):**
   - Changed "Before creating any date-based file" → "Before making ANY date reference"
   - Added "Conversational date references" to "Applies to:" section
   - Made it explicit: date verification applies to conversation AND file operations

2. **Created Session Learning:**
   - `System/Session_Learnings/2026-02-10.md`
   - Documents the issue, root cause, and solution

3. **Updated MEMORY.md:**
   - Added "Date & Time References" section
   - Includes code snippet for date verification
   - Lists what never to assume
   - Will persist across all future conversations

**Result:** Date verification now covers ALL date mentions, not just file creation. Should prevent future date confusion in conversation.

## Recent Actions (2026-02-10 16:00-16:15)

**✅ System Rollback - Back to Clean State**

After 3+ hours of MCP troubleshooting (Feb 10, 13:00-16:00), rolled back to last working commit (739fcc6 - Feb 9, 21:00).

**What was restored:**
- ✅ Clean working tree
- ✅ All content work preserved (silver video, folder consolidation)
- ✅ Calendar credentials intact (Google authorization working)
- ❌ MCP troubleshooting changes removed (good riddance)

**Decision:** Pause MCP setup indefinitely. Core Dex functionality works fine without MCPs. Focus on actual work (silver video, writing) instead of technical rabbit holes.

## Previous Session Work (2026-02-08 16:38-16:58)

**✅ COMPLETED: YouTube Content Management System Implementation**

Fully implemented a project-based YouTube content system for managing video creation across both DIY-Investors channels (.com and .ai).

**✅ COMPLETED: Obsidian Integration Setup**

Set up Obsidian sync daemon for bidirectional task synchronization between Obsidian and Dex. Configured to run automatically at session start via session-start hook.

**✅ COMPLETED: Fixed Windows Startup Hook Error**

Hook temporarily disabled - Claude Code starts successfully. Need to debug why hook was hanging (likely Obsidian daemon check or PowerShell command parsing).
