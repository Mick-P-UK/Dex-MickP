# Session Log

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11 08:40
**Status:** 🎬 Silver video editing - Morning prep work

## Current Focus

**🎬 Silver Video Production - Wednesday Morning**

Morning session (08:00-12:00):
- Dex context uploads
- Review raw video footage
- Plan editing workflow for Thu + Sat

**⚡ Dex Improvements Captured (for later):**
Three quick-win improvements identified via `/dex-improve` capability audit:
1. ✅ Enable SessionStart hook (5 min) - Auto-display session log at startup
2. ✅ Add daily review routine (10 min setup) - Systematic learning capture
3. ✅ Connect calendar integration (15 min) - Automatic meeting intelligence

**Tasks created:** ^task-20260211-001, ^task-20260211-002, ^task-20260211-003
**Next session reminder:** "Ready to set up those three Dex improvements? They'll take 30 min total."

## Recent Actions (2026-02-11 08:00-08:05)

**✅ Daily Plan Created - Wednesday Feb 11 (Updated with actual availability)**

Generated comprehensive daily plan for Wednesday with full context:
- **Week progress:** Day 3 of 5, Priority 1 (Silver Video) in progress
- **Filming status:** Complete ✅ (recorded Tuesday with v1.3 script)
- **Editing status:** Not started yet ⚠️
- **Today's availability:** Morning only (08:00-12:00) — Out 12:00-17:00 for social visit
- **Today's focus:** Upload Dex context + review footage + plan editing workflow
- **Main editing day:** Thursday (full day available)
- **Publishing timeline:** Sunday Feb 16 (Thu + Sat for editing)

## Recent Actions (2026-02-10 17:56-18:16)

**📚 Complete Development Ecosystem with Dual Approaches**

**Purpose:** Systematic exploration of Dex development capabilities, revealing dual approaches (technical vs simplified) for both MCPs and Skills.

**Skills loaded - organized by pattern:**

**MCP Lifecycle (Dual Creation Approaches + Integration + Installation):**
1. **MCP Builder** (17:56) - Technical guide for custom MCP development
2. **Create MCP** (18:12) - Guided wizard for custom MCP creation
3. **Integrate MCP** (18:10) - Connect pre-built MCPs from Smithery.ai
4. **Dex Add MCP** (18:14) - Safely add MCPs with proper scoping

**Skill Lifecycle (Dual Creation Approaches):**
5. **Skill Creator** (17:58) - Technical guide for comprehensive skill creation
6. **Create Skill** (18:16) - Simple command for protected custom skills

**Frontend & Testing:**
7. **Web Artifacts Builder** (18:00) - Frontend/UI with React + TypeScript
8. **Web App Testing** (18:01) - QA automation with Playwright

**System Maintenance:**
9. **Dex Update** (18:02) - System updates (excellent skill reference)

**Key insights - Parallel Dual Approaches:**
- **MCPs:** Technical (`/anthropic-mcp-builder`) vs Wizard (`/create-mcp`)
- **Skills:** Technical (`/anthropic-skill-creator`) vs Simple (`/create-skill`)
- **Pattern:** Choose based on skill level and need for control
- **Protection:** Both approaches create update-safe implementations

**Git operations:**
- ✅ First commit (18:03-18:07): "Document development toolkit exploration session" (792a2ee..1a40d45)
- ✅ Second commit (18:17): "Document complete development ecosystem with dual approaches" (1a40d45..c41025f)
- ✅ Both commits pushed to GitHub successfully

**Session wrap-up (18:20):**
- Marked exploration session as complete
- All skills documented and catalogued
- Dual approach pattern identified and documented
- Ready for future development work

**Session outcome:**
- **9 comprehensive development skills explored**
- **Complete MCP lifecycle** understood (build → integrate → add)
- **Complete Skill lifecycle** understood (technical vs simple creation)
- **Dual approach pattern** discovered for flexible development
- **All documentation committed** to GitHub

**Next session:** Apply this knowledge to build MCPs, Skills, or React UIs as needed.

## Recent Actions (2026-02-10 16:15-16:30)

**✅ Permanent Date Verification Fix**

After incorrectly saying "Wednesday (today)" when it was Tuesday Feb 10, implemented permanent fix:

1. **Updated CLAUDE.md (line 619):**
   - Changed "Before creating any date-based file" → "Before making ANY date reference"
   - Added "Conversational date references" to "Applies to:" section
   - Made it explicit: date verification applies to conversation AND file operations

2. **Created Session Learning:**
   - `System/Session_Learnings/2026-02-10.md`
   - Documents the issue, root cause, and solution

3. **Updated MEMORY.md:**
   - Added "Date & Time References" section
   - Includes code snippet for date verification
   - Lists what never to assume
   - Will persist across all future conversations

**Result:** Date verification now covers ALL date mentions, not just file creation. Should prevent future date confusion in conversation.

## Recent Actions (2026-02-10 16:00-16:15)

**✅ System Rollback - Back to Clean State**

After 3+ hours of MCP troubleshooting (Feb 10, 13:00-16:00), rolled back to last working commit (739fcc6 - Feb 9, 21:00).

**What was restored:**
- ✅ Clean working tree
- ✅ All content work preserved (silver video, folder consolidation)
- ✅ Calendar credentials intact (Google authorization working)
- ❌ MCP troubleshooting changes removed (good riddance)

**Decision:** Pause MCP setup indefinitely. Core Dex functionality works fine without MCPs. Focus on actual work (silver video, writing) instead of technical rabbit holes.

## Previous Session Work (2026-02-08 16:38-16:58)

**✅ COMPLETED: YouTube Content Management System Implementation**

Fully implemented a project-based YouTube content system for managing video creation across both DIY-Investors channels (.com and .ai).

**✅ COMPLETED: Obsidian Integration Setup**

Set up Obsidian sync daemon for bidirectional task synchronization between Obsidian and Dex. Configured to run automatically at session start via session-start hook.

**✅ COMPLETED: Fixed Windows Startup Hook Error**

Hook temporarily disabled - Claude Code starts successfully. Need to debug why hook was hanging (likely Obsidian daemon check or PowerShell command parsing).
