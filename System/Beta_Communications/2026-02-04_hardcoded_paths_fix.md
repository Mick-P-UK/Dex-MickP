#  Quick Update: Path Bug Fixed

**TL;DR:** A bug was hiding in plain sight. Run `/dex-update` to fix it.

---

## What happened?

When I built Dex, some file paths got hardcoded to my machine (`/Users/dave/Dex/Dex/...`). 

Yes, I'm blushing. 

These paths slipped through because everything worked perfectly... on my computer. Classic.

## What was actually broken?

**Affected features:**

| Feature | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| `/dex-obsidian-setup` | Wouldn't work at all |
| Background automation | Changelog checker and learning review scripts wouldn't run |
| Some maintenance scripts | Would fail if you tried to run them manually |

**Not affected (these always worked fine):**
- [x] `/daily-plan`, `/daily-review`, `/week-plan`, `/week-review`
- [x] Task management and syncing
- [x] Meeting processing (`/process-meetings`)
- [x] Person and project pages
- [x] Career features
- [x] All your data (nothing was lost or corrupted)

So if you hadn't tried `/dex-obsidian-setup` or the background scripts, you probably didn't notice anything wrong. But now those features will actually work!

## How to fix it

Just run:

```
/dex-update
```

That's it. Takes about 30 seconds.

## Thank you 

Big thanks to the community members who reported these issues. Your feedback caught something my testing missed - because I was only testing on... my machine.

Lesson learned: test on machines that don't have "dave" in the path. 

Keep the feedback coming. You're making Dex better for everyone.

- Dave
