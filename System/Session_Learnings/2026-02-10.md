## [16:25] - Date Verification Must Apply to ALL Date References

**What happened:**
In conversation about silver video timeline, I said "Wednesday (today)" when the actual day was Tuesday, February 10th. User had to correct me.

**Why it matters:**
The Date Verification section in CLAUDE.md (lines 617-655) covers date verification for **file creation**, but doesn't explicitly cover **conversational date references**. When talking about timelines, schedules, or referring to "today/tomorrow/yesterday", dates must be verified the same way.

**Root cause:**
I assumed the day of the week based on the date (Feb 10) without programmatically calculating what day of the week it actually is. The existing Date Verification guidelines focus on file creation but don't explicitly say "verify dates before ANY reference in conversation."

**Suggested fix:**
Expand CLAUDE.md Date Verification section to explicitly include:
- **Conversational date references** - When mentioning "today", "tomorrow", "yesterday", or day names in conversation
- **Timeline presentations** - When showing schedules or sequences of dates
- **Date-based assumptions** - Any time you reference a date or day name, verify it first

Add new rule: "Before making ANY date or day reference in conversation (not just file creation), programmatically verify the current date and day of week."

**Status:** pending
