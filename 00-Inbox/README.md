# Inbox

Your capture zone for quick notes, meeting notes, and ideas.

## How to use:

- **Meetings/**: Meeting notes go here automatically when you process them
- **Ideas/**: Quick thoughts, feature ideas, things to explore later

## Processing your inbox:

Run `/triage` periodically to:
- Move items to the right place
- Extract tasks
- Create person/project pages as needed
- Archive what's done

---

*The inbox is meant to be messy - that's its job. Process it regularly to keep things organized.*
