# Content Extraction Skill

## What This Does

This skill transforms long-form content (videos, podcasts, articles, transcripts) into a comprehensive content pipeline. It produces organized tables of content ideas tailored to specific platforms, ready for you to write.

**Use this when you have:**
- A YouTube video transcript
- A podcast episode
- A long article or blog post
- Interview recordings
- Any substantial content you want to repurpose

---

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Provide Your Source Content

Paste or upload your long-form content. The more complete the source, the better the extraction.

### Step 2: Choose Your Platforms

Tell me which platforms you want content for:

- **Newsletters** (thought leadership, how-to guides)
- **Substack Notes** (short-form insights)
- **Twitter/X** (threads and standalone posts)
- **LinkedIn** (professional posts)
- **YouTube Shorts / Reels** (short-form video)
- **Other** (specify)

Also helpful:
- How many ideas per platform? (Default: 5-10)
- Any specific angles or themes to prioritize?

## Quality Standards

Every extracted idea will be:

**Traceable** - Directly sourced from your content, not invented

**Specific** - Includes hook, angle, and key points (not just "write about X")

**Platform-Native** - Formatted for how that platform works

**Actionable** - Detailed enough to write immediately

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **One source, many angles** - The same insight can become a newsletter deep-dive AND a punchy tweet AND a LinkedIn story

2. **Repurpose, don't repeat** - Each platform version should feel native, not copy-pasted

3. **Lead with pain points** - Ideas that address your audience's struggles will always outperform

4. **Include contrarian takes** - These drive engagement across all platforms

5. **Quality over quantity** - If your source doesn't have enough material for a platform, I'll note it rather than create weak ideas

## Get Started

Just paste your content and tell me which platforms you want ideas for. I'll handle the rest.
