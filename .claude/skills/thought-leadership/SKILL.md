# Newsletter: Thought Leadership

**Purpose:** Write value-packed thought leadership newsletters (800-1,500 words) that educate, entertain, and position the writer as the go-to authority in their space.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- User asks to write a newsletter or weekly email
- User mentions "thought leadership" or "educational newsletter"
- User wants to create value-packed content for their audience
- User provides a topic/idea and wants a full newsletter written

## Core Philosophy

This is NOT generic content. This is NOT AI slop. This is:

- **Authority-building** — You're not just sharing information, you're establishing expertise through original insight and battle-tested experience
- **Value-dense** — Every paragraph earns its place. No throat-clearing, no filler, no "in today's fast-paced world" nonsense
- **Skim-optimized** — A reader scanning just the headers should walk away with 80% of the value
- **Audience-obsessed** — Written for a specific person with specific problems, not "everyone interested in X"

**Target Length**: 800-1,500 words (enough to go deep, short enough to respect attention)

## The 4 Pillars of a Killer Newsletter

Every newsletter that converts has four components working together:

| Pillar | Job |
|--------|-----|
| **Subject Line** | Get the open. Everything else is worthless if they don't click. |
| **Introduction** | Hook them in 3 seconds, make a promise they can't ignore |
| **Headers** | Deliver standalone value—readers should learn just by scrolling |
| **Section Content** | Tactical, specific, "I can use this today" insights |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Context Profiles

Before writing a single word, load all context profiles from `/context/core/`:

- `voice-dna-mick.json` — How the user actually sounds (not how AI thinks they should sound)
- `icp.json` — The specific human they're writing for
- `business-profile.json` — What they offer and why it matters

These aren't optional. Skip them and you're writing for nobody.

---

### Step 2: Craft Subject Lines That Demand Opens

**Generate 5 subject line variations using this proven structure:**

The anatomy of a subject line that gets clicked:

| Component | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Number** | Creates specificity, signals clear value | 3, 5, 7 (odd numbers work best) |
| **Topic** | What you're teaching | "prompts", "newsletter systems", "AI workflows" |
| **Approach** | The lens you're using | Tips, Steps, Mistakes, Lessons, Reasons, Secrets |
| **Audience** | Who this is for (optional but powerful) | "for solopreneurs", "every creator needs" |
| **Outcome** | The tangible result they want | "write newsletters in 30 minutes" |
| **Bonus Outcome** | The cherry on top (optional) | "without burning out" |

**Formula in action:**

```
[Number] + [approach] + [topic] + [outcome] + [bonus outcome]
```

**Examples that work:**

- "5 prompts I use to write newsletters in 30 minutes (instead of 3 hours)"
- "The 3 context files that make AI actually sound like you"
- "7 newsletter mistakes that are killing your open rates"
- "Why most AI writing fails (and the simple fix)"
- "I deleted 47 Claude prompts. Here's the only 3 I kept."

**Subject Line Rules:**

| Rule | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **30-50 characters ideal** | Shows fully on mobile, creates urgency |
| **60 characters max** | Gets cut off after this |
| **Sentence-case only** | "5 ways to build your system" not "5 Ways To Build Your System" |
| **If starts with number** | Don't capitalize the next word |

**The Outcome Test:**

Every subject line must pass this test—is the outcome tangible?

| Type | Example | Verdict |
|------|---------|---------|
| ❌ Vague | "So you can be more productive" | Means nothing |
| ❌ Generic | "To improve your writing" | Says nothing specific |
| ✅ Tangible | "So you can publish daily without burning out" | Clear, measurable, desirable |
| ✅ Specific | "To cut your writing time from 4 hours to 45 minutes" | Exact numbers, real result |

### Step 3: Write an Introduction That Hooks

The introduction has ONE job: make them keep reading.

**The 5-Part Introduction Framework:**

#### Part 1: The Greeting
Simple. Human. Warm.

- "Hey there!"
- "Hey!"
- Or skip it entirely and dive in

Don't overthink this. It's a handshake, not a speech.

#### Part 2: The Opening Hook (1 sentence that stops the scroll)

You have 3 seconds. Choose your weapon:

| Hook Type | Example | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Thought-provoking question** | "What if everything you know about prompting is wrong?" | When challenging assumptions |
| **Bold declarative statement** | "AI writing doesn't have to sound like AI." | When making a strong claim |
| **Specific moment/realization** | "Last Tuesday I deleted 47 prompts. Here's why." | When you have a story |
| **Vulnerable admission** | "I wasted 6 months prompting the wrong way." | When building trust through honesty |
| **Contrarian take** | "Prompt engineering is dead. Context engineering is the future." | When going against conventional wisdom |
| **Surprising stat/insight** | "I spent 4 hours on every newsletter. Now it takes 35 minutes." | When you have compelling numbers |

**The hook should create an open loop**—a question in the reader's mind that demands an answer.

#### Part 3: The Promise (3-7 sentences)

Now expand. You have two angles:

**Angle A: Lead with the problem**
- What do readers struggle with?
- Why does this problem exist?
- What is it costing them?

**Angle B: Lead with the outcome**
- What's possible on the other side?
- Why does this matter?
- What happens if they don't figure this out?

**Example (Problem-first):**

> Most people using AI for writing are doing it backwards.
>
> They open Claude. They prompt. They get generic slop. They try to fix it. They get frustrated. They give up and write manually anyway.
>
> The problem isn't AI. It's not your prompts either.
>
> It's that you're missing the layer that makes AI actually useful: context.

**Example (Outcome-first):**

> Imagine opening Claude and getting a first draft that sounds like you wrote it.
>
> Not "AI-sounding." Not generic. Actually you.
>
> That's not a fantasy. That's what happens when you build the right system.

#### Part 4: The Solution (1-2 sentences)

State exactly what you're giving them. Be specific.

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|----------|-------------|
| "I'll show you how to improve" | "Today I'm breaking down the 3 context files that make AI write like you" |
| "Here's what I've learned" | "Here are the 5 prompts I use every single day" |

#### Part 5: The Transition (1 sentence)

Bridge to the content. Short and punchy.

- "Let's break it down."
- "Here's how it works."
- "Let me show you."
- "Let's dive in."

### Step 4: Create Headers That Deliver Value Alone

**The 80% Rule:** A reader who only scans your headers should walk away with 80% of the value.

Headers aren't labels. They're mini-insights.

**Ways to Structure Your Content:**

| Structure | Best For | Example Headers |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Tips** | Tactical advice | "Tip 3: Use JSON for context profiles, not paragraphs." |
| **Steps** | Sequential processes | "Step 2: Build your Voice DNA profile." |
| **Mistakes** | What to avoid | "Mistake 1: Prompting without context." |
| **Lessons** | Hard-won insights | "Lesson 4: AI can't read your mind (yet)." |
| **Reasons** | Making a case | "Reason 2: Context compounds. Prompts don't." |
| **Examples** | Showing possibilities | "Example 3: How I repurpose one video into 12 posts." |
| **Questions** | Addressing objections | "Won't this take forever to set up?" |
| **Myths** | Busting misconceptions | "Myth: You need to be technical to use Claude Code." |
| **Principles** | Foundational truths | "Principle 1: AI is your co-writer, not your ghostwriter." |
| **Frameworks** | Mental models | "Framework: The Context Triangle." |

**Header Format Rules:**

- **Full sentences** — The header should make sense on its own
- **Delivers value** — Reader learns something just from reading the header
- **Bold, H3 format** — Use ### in markdown
- **Consistent structure** — If you start with "Mistake 1:", keep the pattern

**Header Examples:**

| ❌ Weak (Label) | ✅ Strong (Insight) |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Why context matters" | "Context turns generic AI into your voice." |
| "The importance of structure" | "Structure lets you write once and use forever." |
| "About prompting" | "Prompting without context is like cooking without ingredients." |

**Number of Sections:**

| Sections | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **7-10 sections** | Headers carry most weight, sections stay brief (1-3 paragraphs) |
| **3-5 sections** | Go deeper in each section (3-6 paragraphs), more room to breathe |

Choose based on the topic. Tactical content = more sections. Conceptual content = fewer, deeper sections.

---

### Step 5: Write Section Content That Delivers

Each section follows a rhythm:

```
[Single-sentence opener that sets up the point]

[2-4 sentences of explanation, context, or story]

[Optional: bullets for examples, options, or lists — max ONE bullet section per header]

[Single-sentence closer that lands the point or transitions]
```

**The Content Principles:**

| Principle | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Specific over general** | Real examples, actual numbers, concrete details | "This cut my writing time from 4 hours to 35 minutes" not "This saved me lots of time" |
| **Actionable** | Reader knows exactly what to DO | "Create a file called voice-dna-mick.json in your context folder" |
| **No fluff** | Every sentence earns its place | If you can delete a sentence and lose nothing, delete it |
| **Skimmable** | Easy to scan and extract value | Short paragraphs, white space, clear structure |

**Example Section (Well-Written):**

```markdown
### Context turns generic AI into your voice.

Before you prompt anything, Claude needs to know who you are.

Not your name. Your voice. How you write. What you never say. The phrases you overuse. The rhythm of your sentences. The way you open a newsletter versus close one.

I call this your Voice DNA. It's a structured profile that captures:

- Your tone and personality
- Your sentence patterns and rhythms
- Your signature phrases
- Your boundaries (what you never sound like)

Without this, every prompt starts from zero. With it, Claude writes like you from the first draft.

That's the difference between AI that helps and AI that wastes your time.
```

**What makes this work:**
- Opens with the core insight
- Expands with specific details
- Bullets break down the components
- Closes with a punchy takeaway

### Step 6: Format for Email Readability

Your newsletter lives in an inbox, not a blog. Format accordingly.

**Formatting Rules:**

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Headers** | Bold, ### format, full sentences |
| **Paragraphs** | Short. 1-3 sentences max. One idea per paragraph. |
| **Bullets** | For lists, examples, options. Keep tight. |
| **White space** | Generous. Let it breathe. Line breaks between sections. |
| **Links** | Include where relevant. Don't overdo it. |
| **Bold** | Use for emphasis. Sparingly. |
| **ALL CAPS** | Almost never. Maybe ONE word for emphasis. |

**The Scroll Test:**

Before you finish, scroll through quickly. Ask:
- Can I get the main points just from headers?
- Does each paragraph look inviting (not dense)?
- Is there enough white space?

---

## Output Format

When delivering a newsletter, use this structure:

```
## Subject Line Options

1. [Option 1 - sentence-case]
2. [Option 2 - sentence-case]
3. [Option 3 - sentence-case]

5. [Option 5 - sentence-case]

**Recommended**: Option [X] — [Why this one works best]

---

## Newsletter Draft

**Word count**: ~[X] words

---

Hey there!

[Opening hook — 1 sentence that stops the scroll]

[Promise — 3-7 sentences on the problem or outcome]

[Solution — 1-2 sentences on what you're delivering today]

[Transition — 1 sentence]

### [Header 1: Full sentence that delivers value.]

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### Mistake 1: Vague Headers

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| "Why context matters" | "Context turns generic AI into your voice." |
| "The importance of skills" | "Skills let you write instructions once and use them forever." |
| "Understanding AI writing" | "AI writing fails when you skip the context layer." |

**Fix:** Turn every header into a complete insight. If it's not a takeaway, rewrite it.

### Mistake 2: Generic Advice

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| "Be consistent with your content" | "Publish every Tuesday at 9am. Your audience will expect it." |
| "Build a system" | "Create three JSON files: voice-dna, icp, business-profile." |
| "Use AI effectively" | "Give Claude your last 10 newsletters before asking it to write a new one." |

**Fix:** Replace every general statement with a specific action, number, or example.

### Mistake 3: No Specifics

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| "This saved me a lot of time" | "This cut my newsletter writing from 4 hours to 35 minutes." |
| "My audience grew" | "I went from 500 to 3,400 subscribers in 6 months." |
| "It works really well" | "My open rates jumped from 32% to 51%." |

**Fix:** Add numbers. Add timeframes. Add before/after. Add proof.

### Mistake 4: All Teaching, No Personality

The newsletter should sound like a person, not a textbook.

**Ways to add personality:**
- Include your actual opinions ("I think most prompting advice is wrong")
- Share real moments ("Last week I deleted 47 prompts")
- Use your language patterns (check voice-dna-mick.json)
- Have a point of view ("Everyone says X. I disagree.")

**Fix:** After writing, read it out loud. If it sounds like a robot, rewrite the flat parts.

## The Philosophy Behind Great Newsletters

### Thought Leadership = Teaching + Point of View

Information is free. Everywhere. Anyone can Google "how to use AI for writing."

What they can't Google:
- Your specific experience doing it
- Your framework for thinking about it
- Your opinion on what actually works
- Your mistakes and what you learned

**Thought leadership isn't about knowing more. It's about having a clearer lens.**

### Every Newsletter Should Do Three Things

| Goal | How You Achieve It |
|------|-------------------|
| **Deliver real value** | Reader learns something useful they can apply today |
| **Establish authority** | You clearly know what you're talking about (specifics, experience, depth) |
| **Sound like the writer** | Not generic, not AI-sounding, unmistakably them |

### The Reader Test

When someone finishes your newsletter, they should think:

- "This is exactly what I needed."
- "I know exactly what to do next."
- "This person actually knows their stuff."
- "I need to share this."

If they think "that was fine" — you've failed. Fine doesn't get forwarded. Fine doesn't build authority.

**Write newsletters that are impossible to ignore.**
